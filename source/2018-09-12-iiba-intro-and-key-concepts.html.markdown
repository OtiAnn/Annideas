### The Business Analysis Core Concept Model (BACCM)

The BACCM encompasses six core concepts which are equal and necessary. Each core concept is defined by the other five core concepts and cannot be fully understood until all the concepts are understood. 

1. Change

The act of transformation in response to a need.

Change works to improve the performance of an enterprise. These improvements are deliberate and controlled through business analysis activities.

2. Need

A problem or opportunity to be addressed.

Needs can cause changes by motivating stakeholders to act. Changes can also cause needs by eroding or enhancing the value delivered by existing solutions.

3. Solution

A specific way of satisfying one or more needs in a context.

A solution satisfies a need by resolving a problem faced by stakeholders or enabling stakeholders to take advantage of an opportunity.

4. Stakeholder

A group or individual with a relationship to the change, the need, or the solution.


5. Value

6. Context
