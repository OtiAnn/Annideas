**Welcome to my blog!**

I'm currently enrolled at George Brown College in postgraduate program in Information Systems Business Analysis.

If you are looking at this article, I guess you must be the new friend I just met in Toronto. So let me put a brief introduction here! And if you are interested what I've done before, kindly see my previous experience thru this link: [http://blog.annideas.com/en/resume](/en/resume)

I have more than 2 years of IT background to develop web applications and content management systems using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. And I have more than 7 years teaching background, which is my solid background in utilizing varied approaches to communicate information to adapt to various group of stakeholders.

My strengths include effective communication skills and create efficiency working flow. My goal in Toronto is to integrate my IT background and Business Analysis knowledge. **I hope to know more Business Analyst's world :)**
